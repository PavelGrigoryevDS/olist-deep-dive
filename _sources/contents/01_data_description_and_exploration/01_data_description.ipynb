        "The dataset is an extensive collection of e-commerce data from Brazil. It was gathered by Olist, a company that provides an online sales platform. The dataset covers the period from 2016 to 2018 and includes information about purchases made on the Olist platform.\n",

        "Olist operates as a marketplace, enabling small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products through various channels, including major platforms like Amazon and Mercado Livre. Integration with other marketplaces allows sellers to manage orders and inventory centrally, significantly expanding their reach and simplifying the sales process.\n",

        "Products listed on Olist can automatically be offered for sale on other platforms, increasing visibility and potential sales. However, the dataset only includes data on sales made directly through the Olist platform. It is important to note that since Olist also sells its products through various marketplaces, buyers may prefer to make purchases on those platforms rather than on the Olist website.\n",
