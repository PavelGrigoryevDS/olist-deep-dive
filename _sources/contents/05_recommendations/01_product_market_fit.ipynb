        "- Find ways to increase the number of active buyers, as growth has stalled since 2018. Meanwhile, the number of sellers continues to grow, risking an imbalance.\n",
        "- Reduce the time between first and second purchases, as currently ~50% of customers take more than 29 days to make a second purchase."
