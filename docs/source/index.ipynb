        "Data from September 2016 to October 2018 will be used for the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Conclusions:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Sales Trends:\n",
        "  - **Growth & Stabilization**: Sales volume and revenue grew until 2018, then stabilized at 6â€“7K orders and 1â€“1.2M R$ per month.\n",
        "  - **Black Friday (11/24/2017)**: Record spikes in orders, revenue, and buyers.\n",
        "  - **Geography**: Sao Paulo dominates (42% of sales), with steady growth in 2018, unlike other regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Customer Behavior:\n",
        "  - **Low Retention**: 97% of buyers made only one purchase; repeat buyers are rare.\n",
        "  - **High-Value Buyers**: Clients using installment plans (50%) spend 2x more (higher average order value/weight).\n",
        "  - **Loyalty**: Promoters (58% of buyers) leave positive reviews but rarely return. Critics (13%) spend more but churn faster due to delivery delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Operational Insights:\n",
        "  - Delayed orders correlate with lower ratings (avg. rating: 1â€“2 vs. 4â€“5 for on-time).\n",
        "  - Heavy/expensive orders take longer to deliver and are more likely to be delayed.\n",
        "  - Orders with installments process faster, have higher AOV, and show better retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Payment & Risk:\n",
        "  - **Credit cards dominate**: 74% of transactions, with 35% higher AOV vs. other methods.\n",
        "  - **Installments boost value**: Orders with installments have 2x higher AOV (premium/heavy items).\n",
        "  - **Voucher Payments**: Orders paid with vouchers have 3x higher cancellation rates (16% vs. 5% for credit cards).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Product & Logistics:\n",
        "  - **Top Categories**: Electronics (27% of sales) and furniture (18%) drive revenue.\n",
        "  - Northern states take 2x longer delivery.\n",
        "  - Heavy orders (+40% delivery time) and premium items face delays.\n",
        "  - **Delivery Bottlenecks**: 70% of total delivery time is spent with carriers, notably slower in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Critical Challenges:\n",
        "  - **Declining Ratings**: Average review scores dropped from 4.5 (2017) to 3.9 (2018), linked to delivery delays.\n",
        "  - **Peak Season Failures**: Black Friday 2017 caused a surge in delayed deliveries, with complaints tied to carrier handoff bottlenecks.\n",
        "  - **Abandoned Carts**: Canceled orders spike in February/August 2018, often for high-value items paid via vouchers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Customer Feedback & Ratings:\n",
        "  - **Majority of reviews are positive**: 58% of reviews received a rating of 5. Only 12% of reviews received a rating of 1, while a mere 3% received a rating of 2.\n",
        "  - **Negative Reviews**: 15% of review text mentions \"slow delivery\" or \"missing items,\" heavily impacting NPS.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data Highlights:\n",
        "  - **Negative Feedback Drivers**: Low ratings correlate with longer delivery times, higher order value, and heavier items.\n",
        "  - **Success Factors**: Fast carrier handoff (â‰¤3 days) and installment options boost ratings and repeat purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Recommendations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Boost Customer Retention & Repeat Purchases:\n",
        "  - Launch a loyalty program targeting one-time buyers (97% of customers), offering discounts on second purchases or bonus points.\n",
        "  - Personalized win-back campaigns for high-value clients (top 1% driving 15% of revenue) with exclusive offers.\n",
        "  - Reduce time between purchases (currently 29+ days for 50% of repeat buyers) via time-bound promotions (e.g., \"7-day discount\").\n",
        "  \n",
        "- Improve Product & Pricing Strategy:\n",
        "  - Expand \"Beauty & Health\" and \"Home & Garden\" (18% YoY growth categories) with curated bundles or subscriptions.\n",
        "  - Reprice problem categories (e.g., \"Watches & Gifts\") to offset delivery costs or offer guaranteed faster shipping.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enhance High-Value Segments:\n",
        "  - Premium installment plans for big spenders (avg. 3+ orders) with perks like free shipping or priority support.\n",
        "  - Target voucher users (3x higher cancellation risk) with limited-time combo deals to convert abandoned carts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Fix Delivery Pain Points:\n",
        "  - Prioritize carrier performance in critical regions (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Salvador), where delays are 30% longer than average.\n",
        "  - Expedite high-value/heavy orders (>500 R$ or >10kg), which face 2x more 1-star ratings due to delays.\n",
        "  - Optimize Black Friday logistics to prevent repeat of 2017â€™s 4x surge in delays (pre-stock inventory, add temporary carriers).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Regional Growth Tactics:\n",
        "  - Hyper-local campaigns in SÃ£o Paulo (42% of sales): Leverage its 20% faster delivery and 30% higher retention to test scalable models.\n",
        "  - Fix underperformers (e.g., MaranhÃ£o, CearÃ¡) with subsidized shipping or partner pickup points.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mitigate Negative Reviews:\n",
        "- Automate compensation for delayed orders (e.g., 10% off next purchase if delivery exceeds 15 days).\n",
        "- Sunday support surge: Add staff to cut response times, reducing low weekend ratings."
